# HELLO

I'm monomadic.

I'm totally into technical minimalism, music and generative graphics, blockchain and decentralisation, nomadding, low level ui, functional programming, psychedelia, macroeconomic activism, reverse engineering and cracking, pessimistic philosophy, and mentos. Predelictions are not in order.

## My technologies of choice are:
- NixOS
- Rust
- Elm

I also kinda like flutter, golang and haskell.

I'm looking for work! I work remotely on anything fun and accept monero or bitcoin. Please get in contact.
